The song opens with the voice of their manager at the time Peter Jenner reading the names of planets through a megaphone, sounding like an astronaut over an intercom. Guitarist and vocalist Syd Barrett's Fender Esquire emerges and grows louder. At 0:19 a rapid beeping sound appears. At 0:26, Nick Mason's drum fills begin, and Barrett plays the enigmatic introductory figure which is discussed in the next section. Keyboardist Richard Wright's Farfisa organ is mixed into the background. Barrett's incantatory lyrics about space support the theme in the song, mentioning planets Jupiter, Saturn, and Neptune as well as Uranian moons Oberon, Miranda, and Titania, and Saturn's moon Titan. Barrett and Wright provide lead vocals. Bassist Roger Waters' aggressive bass line, Wright's Farfisa organ, and Barrett's kinetic slide guitar then dominate, with Jenner's megaphone recitation re-emerging from the mix for a time.\n\nThe verse has an unusual chord progression, all in major chords: E, E♭, G, and A. The chorus is entirely chromatic, descending directly from A to D on guitar, bass, and falsetto singing, down one semitone every three beats. Strangest of all may be the intro, in which Barrett takes an ordinary open E major chord and moves the fretted notes down one semitone, resulting in an E♭ major chord superimposed onto an open E minor chord, fretting E♭ and B♭ notes along with the open E, G, B, and high-E strings of the guitar; the G functions both as major third to the E♭ chord, and minor third to the E chord. In the live version heard on Ummagumma (1969), the post-Barrett band, with David Gilmour on guitar, normalised the intro into straight E and E♭ major chords, also normalising the timing of the intro, but beginning in 1994, began performing a more faithful version (as heard on Pulse), which Gilmour carried into his solo career.", Personnel = "Syd Barrett - lead and slide guitar (Fender Esquire), lead vocals\nRichard Wright - organ (Farfisa), lead vocals\nRoger Waters - bass guitar (Rickenbacker 4001), backing vocals\nNick Mason - drums, percussion\nwith:\nPeter Jenner - intro vocalisations", Image1 = "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/3c/PinkFloyd-album-piperatthegatesofdawn_300.jpg/220px-PinkFloyd-album-piperatthegatesofdawn_300.jpg", AudioSrc = "https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/71957094/Pink%20Floyd/01%20Astronomy%20Domine.mp3" });

Roger Waters repeatedly plays the B on the 16th fret of the G-string by varying the lower note from D to F# on the D string. Unlike many older beat and pop songs, the guitar rarely plays chords, and most unusually for Western music, Wright provides an organ solo in the F# Phrygian dominant scale with a natural sixth instead of its typical flatted counterpart. The song ends with a simple E mixolydian-based waltz with wordless vocal harmonies of Wright and Barrett.\nBarrett originally wrote the song around verses from Hilaire Belloc's Cautionary Tales, in which a series of naughty children, including Matilda, receive their (often gruesome) comeuppance.

The song came about when guitarist Syd Barrett heard the band's manager Peter Jenner humming a song, to which Barrett tried to interpret it by playing it on his guitar. Musically sharing the same theme with \"Astronomy Domine\", the piece was recorded in several takes between March and April 1967. An earlier, longer recording of the song can be heard on the soundtrack to the film Tonite Let's All Make Love in London, which was recorded at Sound Technique Studios in early 1967, and was released in the same year. Other versions of the track appear on various bootleg recordings. The piece has been covered by acts such as T. Rex, Pearl Jam, Hawkwind and Spiral Realms.\n\"Interstellar Overdrive\" was one of the first very psychedelic instrumental improvisations recorded by a rock band. It was seen as Pink Floyd's first foray into space rock (along with \"Astronomy Domine\"), although band members would later disparage this term. \"Interstellar Overdrive\" originated when early Pink Floyd manager Peter Jenner was trying to hum a song he could not remember the name of (most commonly identified as Love's cover of \"My Little Red Book\"). Guitarist and vocalist Syd Barrett followed Jenner's humming with his guitar and used it as the basis for the principal melody of \"Interstellar Overdrive\". Bassist Roger Waters once told Barrett that the song's riff reminded him of the theme tune from Steptoe and Son (by Ron Grainer). Around the time the song was written, Barrett was also inspired by AMM and its guitarist Keith Rowe, who had a pattern of moving pieces of metal along his guitar's fretboard. The free-form section (and also, \"Pow R. Toc H.\") was inspired by Frank Zappa's free-form freak-outs and The Byrds' \"Eight Miles High\".\n\"Interstellar Overdrive\" shares an emphasis on chromaticism with \"Astronomy Domine\". The main theme descends chromatically from B to G, before resolving to E, all chords major. The opening hook of the piece is a distorted, descending guitar riff, played by Barrett, its composer, with Waters on bass and Richard Wright on organ. Nick Mason's drums then kick in, and after the riff repeats itself a bit, the track turns into improvisation, including modal improvisations, flourishes on the Farfisa organ, and quiet interludes. The song gradually becomes almost structureless and in free-form tempo, punctuated only by strange guitar noises. Eventually, however, the entire band restates the main theme, which is repeated with decreasing tempo and more deliberate intensity. Waters once called the song \"an abstract piece\". A bass riff in the song later evolved into another Pink Floyd song, \"Let There Be More Light\", which was written by Waters.", Personnel = "", Image1 = "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/3c/PinkFloyd-album-piperatthegatesofdawn_300.jpg/220px-PinkFloyd-album-piperatthegatesofdawn_300.jpg", AudioSrc = "https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/71957094/Pink%20Floyd/07%20Interstellar%20Overdrive.mp3" });

It is the first mention of war in a Pink Floyd song, something that would become a common theme in Roger Waters' lyrics, Roger having lost his father thus in 1944. Waters told Mojo magazine that this song is autobiographical. He explained: \"Corporal Clegg is about my father and his sacrifice in World War II. It's somewhat sarcastic—the idea of the wooden leg being something you won in the war, like a trophy.\" This can be seen as rather lighter in tone than the Pink Floyd's later tackling of the subject, though, despite the irony (Clegg \"won\" his wooden leg in the war) and darkness behind the lyrics; indeed, among the cacophony of voices towards the end we hear an officer telling his one-legged man: \"Clegg!

Both songs contain the same cynical humour, but while on \"Vegetable Man\" Barrett focuses his humour on himself, on \"Jugband Blues\" it is directed towards those around him. \"Jugband Blues\" was recorded on 19 October 1967 at De Lane Lea Studios. Barrett wanted a Salvation Army band to play on the track. He told them he wanted them to simply \"play whatever they want\" regardless of the rest of the group, while Norman Smith insisted on recorded parts. Eventually both versions were recorded and used.

At approximately 4:13, the sound of a honking goose is temporarily introduced, followed by the sound of it taking off.\nThe lyrics describe a pastoral and dream-like scene at the Grantchester meadows in Cambridgeshire, close to where fellow band member David Gilmour lived at the time. This type of pastoral ballad was typical of Roger Waters' compositional approach in the late sixties and early seventies. It was a style that he was to continue on his first album outside of Pink Floyd – Music from \"The Body\" (in collaboration with Ron Geesin) and \"If\" from Atom Heart Mother. It is one of the many Pink Floyd songs that are praises of the British countryside.\nThe song is noted for its use of stereo effects and sound panning to create an illusion of space and depth. This is most noticeable when listening with headphones. The background chirping birds flicker across the channels. The honking goose is first heard in the extreme left channel and the noise of its flight slowly panning to the right.

Years later, Kubrick refused Roger Waters permission to use audio samples from his film 2001: A Space Odyssey on Waters' solo album Amused to Death.\n\nThe number was performed live without the involvement of any members of Pink Floyd for the first time in 36 years on 14 and 15 June 2008 by The Canticum Choir, with the Royal College of Music on brass, Caroline Dale on cello, Ron Geesin on piano, Andrea Beghi on drums, Nadir Morelli on bass, Federico Maremmi on guitar and Emanuele Borgi on the Hammond organ. David Gilmour joined the gig on the second night at Cadogan Hall. It had been previously performed by a number of ensembles including the Conservatoire national supérieur de musique et de danse de Paris (CNSMDP) in March of 2003 and the Seamus Band on 14 October 2005.\n\nThe working title for this piece changed a few times during the composing and recording process. When the first main theme was composed, David Gilmour called it \"Theme From an Imaginary Western\". The first working title for the six-part piece was \"Epic\", written in Ron Geesin's handwriting at the top of his original score. The work was introduced at the 27–28 June 1970 Bath Festival of Blues and Progressive Music as \"The Amazing Pudding\".\n\nIn July 1970 Ron Geesin pointed Roger Waters to the 16 July 1970 edition of the Evening Standard and told him that he would find the song title in the newspaper. Waters saw an article about a pregnant woman who had been fitted with a heart pacemaker.

Extended jams would usually follow, including free-form drumming, organ solos and revised chord progressions based on the \"Sing to me\" vocal line.\n\nMore recently, it was adopted by David Gilmour and performed acoustically in the 2001/02 David Gilmour in Concert shows, minus the electric guitar solo. When the Floyd's manager, Steve O'Rourke, died in 2003, Gilmour, Richard Wright, and Nick Mason played \"Fat Old Sun\" and \"The Great Gig in the Sky\" at O'Rourke's funeral.

Macrobiotic stuff...\"). There are significant breaks before the first and in between all three instrumental parts where only Alan's muttering and movements, with occasional exterior background noise, are heard.

It was performed live three times in the UK during the winter of 1970.\nIn addition to the talking, the sounds of Alan making breakfast—such as lighting the stove, cooking bacon, pouring milk and cereal (which makes a popping sound associated with Kellogg's Rice Krispies), loudly gulping and drinking milk or juice, and loudly and vigorously eating cereal—are clearly audible in the background, which adds a conceptual feel to the track. Alan can be heard entering the kitchen and gathering supplies at the start of the track, and washing up and exiting the kitchen at the end; a dripping tap can be heard during both of these instances.

Gilmour's bass sound is quite muted and dull. According to Gilmour, this is because that particular instrument had old strings on it, and the roadie they had sent to get new strings for it wandered off to see his girlfriend instead\nThe predominant element of the song is that of a bass guitar played through a delay (echo) unit, set to produce repeats in quarter-note triplets. The result of this setting is, if the player plays simple quarter notes, the added echoes will produce a pattern of quarter note - eighth note, quarter note - eighth note. Pink Floyd would again use this technique on the bass line for \"Sheep\".\nThe threat, a rare vocal contribution by Nick Mason, was recorded through a ring modulator and slowed down to create an eerie effect. It was aimed at Sir Jimmy Young, the then BBC Radio 1 and Radio 2 DJ whom the band supposedly disliked because of his tendency to babble. During early 1970s concerts, they sometimes played a sound collage of clips from Young's radio show that was edited to sound completely nonsensical, thus figuratively \"cutting him into little pieces\". The bootleg compilation A Treeful of Secrets contains a demo version of \"One of These Days\" in which the Jimmy Young collage loops in the background during the song. However, the authenticity of this demo has not been confirmed.\nAccording to John Peel, Waters has described \"One of These Days\" as a \"poignant appraisal of the contemporary social situation\".

The track has a running time of 23:31 and takes up the entire second side of the vinyl recording.\nIt also appears in shortened form as the fifth track on the compilation album which took its name, Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd. \"Echoes\" is the third-longest song in Pink Floyd's catalogue, after \"Atom Heart Mother\" (23:44) and the combined segments of \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\" (26:01). Unlike those pieces, it is not explicitly divided into separate parts; however, the composition was originally assembled from separate fragments, and was later split in two parts to serve as both the opening and closing numbers in the band's film Live at Pompeii.\nThe composition uses many progressive and unconventional musical effects. The ping sound heard at the beginning of the song was created as the result of an experiment at the very beginning of the Meddle sessions. It was produced through amplifying a grand piano and sending the signal through a Leslie rotating speaker. Most of the song's musical passages are in the key of C-sharp minor. At seven minutes in, a funk progression in the tonic minor begins. David Gilmour used the slide for certain sound effects on the studio recording, and for the introduction in live performances from 1971-75. A throbbing wind-like sound is created by Roger Waters vibrating the strings of his bass guitar with a steel slide and feeding the signal through a Binson Echorec. The high-pitched electronic 'screams', resembling a distorted seagull song, were discovered by Gilmour when the cables were accidentally reversed to his wah pedal. After observing the song being created, Nick Mason noted, \"The guitar sound in the middle section of 'Echoes' was created inadvertently by David plugging in a wah-wah pedal back to front. Sometimes great effects are the results of this kind of pure serendipity, and we were always prepared to see if something might work on a track. The grounding we'd received from Ron Geesin in going beyond the manual had left its mark.\"\nThe \"choral\"-sounding segment in the middle of the song was created by placing two tape recorders in opposite corners of a room; the main chord tapes of the song were then fed into one recorder and played back while at the same time recording. The other recorder was then also set to play what was being recorded; this created a delay between both recordings, heavily influencing the structure of the chords while at the same time giving it a very \"wet\" and \"echoey\" feel. Harmonic \"whistles\" can be heard produced by Richard Wright pulling certain drawbars in and out on the Hammond organ. Rooks were added to the music from a tape archive recording (as had been done for some of the band's earlier songs, including \"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun\"). The second half of the song where Gilmour plays muted notes on the guitar over Wright's slowly building organ solo was inspired by The Beach Boys song \"Good Vibrations\". The song changes to 12/8 during the riff after the chorus, while most of the song is in 4/4, 6/8 and 6/4 time. Also, the \"whale\" section is in free time. The song concludes with an ascending (rising) Shepard-Risset glissando.\nIn an interview in 2008 with Mojo, when asked who had composed Echoes, Wright stated he had composed the long piano intro and the main chord progression of the song, in the same interview he confirmed that Waters wrote the lyrics. Gilmour has also stated in interviews that musically the song came mainly from him and Wright.\nIn an interview with Rolling Stone, Waters explained that the song's lyrics were an attempt to describe \"the potential that human beings have for recognizing each other's humanity and responding to it, with empathy rather than antipathy.\" He has also stated in many interviews that this song is the ideological predecessor to Dark Side of the Moon, for in \"Echoes\" he began to focus the music of Pink Floyd on people and the issues facing humanity rather than fantastical space trips and psychedelic imagery.", Personnel = "David Gilmour - vocals, electric guitars, sound effects\nRichard Wright - vocals, Hammond M-102 organ, Farfisa Combo Compact Duo organ, grand piano (through Leslie 145 speaker), sound effects\nRoger Waters - bass, slide bass, sound effects\nNick Mason - drums, percussion, sound effects", Image1 = "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d4/MeddleCover.jpeg/220px-MeddleCover.jpeg", AudioSrc = "https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/71957094/Pink%20Floyd/06%20Echoes.mp3" });

The band then added backwards guitar parts, created by dragging a microphone stand down the fretboard, reversing the tape, and panning left to right.

Roger Waters got the idea when he realized he was no longer preparing for anything in life, but was right in the middle of it. He has described this realisation taking place at ages 28 and 29 in various interviews. It is noted for its long introductory passage of clocks chiming and alarms ringing, recorded as a quadrophonic test by Alan Parsons, not specifically for the album.\nEach clock at the beginning of the song was recorded separately in an antiques store.

During 1972 performances of The Dark Side of the Moon song cycle (prior to the album being recorded), it was simply an organ instrumental accompanied by spoken word samples from the Bible and snippets of speeches by Malcolm Muggeridge, a British writer known for his conservative religious views. By the time the band came to record the song for Dark Side, the lead instrument had been switched to a piano rather than an organ. Various sound effects were tried for the track, including recordings of NASA astronauts communicating on space missions, but none were satisfactory. Finally, a couple of weeks before the album was due to be finished, the band decided to try having a female singer \"wail\" over the music.\nAs the band began casting around for a singer, album engineer Alan Parsons suggested Clare Torry, a 25-year-old songwriter and session vocalist. Parsons had previously worked with Torry, and had liked her voice on a compilation album of covers. An accountant from Abbey Road Studios contacted Torry and tried to arrange a session for the same evening, but she was initially unenthusiastic. Torry was not a particular fan of Pink Floyd, and she had various other commitments, including, she later admitted, tickets to see Chuck Berry that evening. Eventually, however, a session was scheduled for the following Sunday.\nThe band played the instrumental track to Torry, and then with very little further direction asked her to improvise a vocal. At first, Torry struggled to divine what the band wanted, but then she was inspired to pretend that she herself was an instrument. She performed two complete takes, the second one more emotional than the first. David Gilmour asked for a third take, but halfway through Torry stopped, feeling she was getting repetitive and had already done the best she could. The final album track was assembled from all three takes. The members of the band were deeply impressed by Torry's performance, but were so reserved in their outward response that she left under the impression that her vocals would never make the final cut.

The doubled effect for the third chorus was created using automatic (or \"artificial\") double-tracking (ADT)\nOne of Gilmour's ideas for the solo section was that, for the second chorus of the solo, all reverb and echo effects would be completely off (referred to as \"dry\"), creating the sense of just four musicians playing in a small room. For this \"dry\" chorus, all musicians played softly and subtly, with Gilmour's solo, now one single guitar, playing very sparsely. Then, for the third chorus, the dynamics would suddenly rise, with heavy use of reverb and echo (a \"wet\" sound), additional rhythm-guitar parts in the background, and the drums becoming heavy and almost chaotic.\nThe form and chord progression are based on the standard twelve-bar blues in the key of B minor, with the vocal melody and nearly all of Gilmour's soloing based on the pentatonic and blues scales. Two twelve-bar verses are followed by a twenty-bar instrumental section that features a blues-style tenor saxophone solo (played by Dick Parry) along with keyboard, bass and drums and a further two-bar intro in 4/4 leading to the guitar solo, which is structured like a twelve-bar blues, but doubled to a twenty-four-bar length\nThe lyrics are briefly referenced in the film Pink Floyd – The Wall, when the protagonist, Pink, is caught writing poems in class by his teacher. The teacher snatches the poem from him and reads it in a very sarcastic, demeaning manner, practically encouraging Pink's classmates to laugh. The poem is a verse of lyrics to \"Money\".\n", Personnel = "David Gilmour - guitars, vocals\nRoger Waters - bass guitar, tape effects\nRichard Wright - Wurlitzer electric piano\nNick Mason - drums\nwith:\nDick Parry - tenor saxophone", Image1 = "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/3b/Dark_Side_of_the_Moon.png/220px-Dark_Side_of_the_Moon.png", AudioSrc = "https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/71957094/Pink%20Floyd/06%20Money.mp3" });

The song is 7 minutes, 51 seconds in length, making it the longest on the album.\nRichard Wright wrote a song known as \"The Violent Sequence\" while the band was working for the score of Zabriskie Point. Then the song was reworked into \"Us and Them\". \"The Violent Sequence\" remained unreleased until it was included on a 2011 boxed set of \"The Dark Side of the Moon,\" where it was named \"Us and Them (Richard Wright Demo)\".\n\"Us and Them\" is rather quiet in tone and dynamics, with prominent jazz influence, although the choruses are louder than the verses. It has two saxophone solos in it, one at the beginning and another towards the end of the song. Richard Wright introduces the song with harmonies on his Hammond organ, and put a piano chordal backing and short piano solo afterwards on the arrangement. The tune was originally written on the piano by Wright for the film Zabriskie Point in 1969 and was titled \"The Violent Sequence\". In its original demo form it was instrumental, featuring only piano and bass. Director Michelangelo Antonioni rejected it on the grounds that it was too unlike material such as \"Careful with That Axe, Eugene\", which was the style of music he wanted to use. As Roger Waters recalls it in impersonation, Antonioni's response was, \"It's beautiful, but is it too sad, you know? It makes me think of church\". The song was shelved until The Dark Side of the Moon where Waters put some lyrics to it.\nThe verses have a unique, jazz-influenced chord progression: Dsus2, D6add9 (or Esus2/D), D minor major 7 (or Faug/D), and G/D (the D in the bass is sustained as a pedal point throughout). The D6 with an added 9th is not unlike an Esus2 with a D in the bass, but because the bass line also provides the fifth, it is more accurately described as a kind of D chord. The D minor chord with a major seventh is a rarity in 1970s rock music. There is also an alternate sequence, played louder and with multiple harmonies, with a progression of B minor, A major, G major seventh suspended second (Gmaj7sus2), enharmonic to the slash chord D/G, and C major. This progression is played twice between each verse, and is not unlike a chorus, except that the lyrics are different with each repeat.\nIt was also re-released on the 2001 best of album, Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd, where it is the seventh track of the second disc. The ending of the song was edited in this version, with the vocals from the last measure treated with heavy delay, and the music track muted entirely, to avoid the seamless transition to \"Any Colour You Like\" that occurs on The Dark Side of the Moon.", Personnel = "David Gilmour - electric guitars, lead vocals\nRoger Waters - bass, fuzz bass, backing vocals\nRichard Wright – Hammond organ, piano, harmony vocals\nNick Mason - drums\nDick Parry - tenor saxophone\nLesley Duncan - backing vocals\nDoris Troy - backing vocals\nBarry St. John - backing vocals\nLiza Strike - backing vocals", Image1 = "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/3b/Dark_Side_of_the_Moon.png/220px-Dark_Side_of_the_Moon.png", AudioSrc = "https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/71957094/Pink%20Floyd/07%20Us%20And%20Them.mp3" });

It is approximately three minutes, 25 seconds in length. The song used advanced effects for the time both in the keyboard and the guitar. The VCS 3 synthesizer was fed through a long tape loop to create the rising and falling keyboard solo. David Gilmour used two guitars with the Uni-Vibe guitar effect to create the harmonizing guitar solo for the rest of the song. \"Any Colour You Like\" is also known (and is even listed on the Dark Side guitar tablature book) as \"Breathe (Second Reprise)\" because the song shares the same beat (albeit somewhat funkier and uptempo) as the album's first song \"Breathe\". It has also nearly the same chord sequence just transposed a whole step lower from E minor to D minor.\nWhile the song is instrumental, it has been speculated that the song ties to The Dark Side of the Moon concept by considering the lack of choice one has in human society, while being deluded into thinking one does. It is also speculated that the song is about the fear of making choices. The origin of the title is unclear. One possible origin of the title comes from an answer frequently given by a studio technician to questions put to him: \"You can have it any colour you like\", which was a reference to Henry Ford's apocryphal description of the Model T: \"You can have it any color you like, as long as it's black.\" (Ford said something very like this in his autobiography. Although the Model T was in fact produced in other colours, those that were had all been produced before the introduction of moving conveyor belts sped up production.

David Gilmour sang the lead vocal when Pink Floyd performed it live on their 1994 tour (as can be heard on Pulse). The band originally called this track \"Lunatic\" during live performances and recording sessions. This song was one of several to be considered for the band's \"best of\" album, Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd.\nWhen the band reconvened after the American leg of the Meddle tour, Roger Waters brought with him a prototype version of \"Brain Damage\" along with other songs such as \"Money\". He had been playing the song during the recording of the Meddle album in 1971, when it was called \"The Dark Side of the Moon\". Eventually this title would be used for the album itself. The song seemed to be partially inspired by their former band member Syd Barrett who had endured a mental breakdown. After road testing, the new suite entitled \"A Piece for Assorted Lunatics\", the song was recorded in October along with \"Any Colour You Like\". The piece represents Waters' association with acoustic-tinged ballads, and along with \"If\" and \"Grantchester Meadows\", \"Brain Damage\" uses a simple melody and delivery. David Gilmour actively encouraged Waters to sing the song, even though at this time he wasn't particularly confident about his vocal abilities.\nRoger Waters has stated that the insanity-themed lyrics are based on former Floyd frontman Syd Barrett's mental instability, with the line \"I'll see you on the dark side of the moon\" indicating that he felt related to him in terms of mental idiosyncrasies. The line \"And if the band you're in starts playing different tunes...\" references Barrett's behaviour near the end of his tenure with the band; because of his mental problems, there were more than a few occasions where Barrett would play a different song than the rest of the band in the middle of a concert. The song has a rather famous opening line, \"The lunatic is on the grass...\", whereby Waters is referring to areas of turf which display signs saying \"Please keep off the grass\" with the exaggerated implication that disobeying such signs might indicate insanity. The lyrics' tongue-in-cheek nature is further emphasised by Waters' assertion in the 2003 documentary Classic Albums: Pink Floyd – The Making of The Dark Side of the Moon that not letting people on such beautiful grass was the real insanity.

After Waters left, Gilmour sang the lead when performing live. This song was one of several to be considered for the band's \"best of\" album, Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd.\nThe song is often mistakenly labelled \"The Dark Side of the Moon\" alongside \"Brain Damage\" because the two run together and are commonly played together on the radio, giving the impression that they are one song. The incorrect title is derived from a recurring lyric in \"Brain Damage\" (\"I'll see you on the dark side of the moon\") and the title of the album.\nThis song serves as the album's climax and features a loud, repetitive melody that builds up, then ends with a very quiet outro. When the main instrumentation ends at 1:30, the sound of a heartbeat from the first track, \"Speak to Me\", appears, which appears again in 9/8, and gradually fades to silence.\nThe song consists of a repeating four chord pattern: D major, D over C in the bass (a compound chord usually notated as \"D/C\".), B-flat major seventh (\"B♭maj7\" – this chord can be heard as a D minor over a B♭ bass, or \"Dm/B♭\", a slash chord), and A7 (with a suspended fourth resolving to the major third – notated as A7sus4 to A7). However, the arrangement adds variety. David Gilmour recorded two tracks of rhythm guitar, playing arpeggios, one in open position, and one much higher, around the tenth fret. The lower-pitched guitar part includes the open G and E strings during the B♭maj7, resulting in an added sixth and a dissonant augmented fourth. However, these notes become consonant as they sustain through to the next chord, A7. The quartet of female backing singers vary their parts, rising in volume, and echoing some of Roger Waters' lyrics, as the piece builds in intensity. On the last repetition of the chord progression, the B♭maj7 leads directly to a climax on D major, resulting in a \"brightening\" effect (known as the Picardy third), as the aforementioned implication of D minor in the B♭maj7 chord shifts to the major.\nThe final words sung on the song and, indeed the album The Dark Side of the Moon directs the listener, \"and everything under the sun is in tune, but the sun is eclipsed by the moon.\" Waters explained the meaning of these words as well as the entire song by asserting:\n\n\"I don't see it as a riddle. The album uses the sun and the moon as symbols; the light and the dark; the good and the bad; the life force as opposed to the death force. I think it's a very simple statement saying that all the good things life can offer are there for us to grasp, but that the influence of some dark force in our natures prevents us from seizing them. The song addresses the listener and says that if you, the listener, are affected by that force, and if that force is a worry to you, well I feel exactly the same too. The line 'I'll see you on the dark side of the moon' is me speaking to the listener, saying, 'I know you have these bad feelings and impulses because I do too, and one of the ways I can make direct contact with you is to share with you the fact that I feel bad sometimes.\"\n\n", Personnel = "Roger Waters — bass, lead vocals\nDavid Gilmour — electric guitars, backing vocals\nRichard Wright — Hammond organ, backing vocals\nNick Mason — drums, percussion, tape effects\nwith:\nLesley Duncan — backing vocals\nDoris Troy — backing vocals\nBarry St. John — backing vocals\nLiza Strike — backing vocals", Image1 = "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/3b/Dark_Side_of_the_Moon.png/220px-Dark_Side_of_the_Moon.png", AudioSrc = "https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/71957094/Pink%20Floyd/10%20Eclipse.mp3" });

", Trivia = "\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\", along with the rest of the album, was written about the band's former leader, Syd Barrett. The work is a suite of nine parts, that was originally planned to take up the first side of the LP. \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\" was written at the same time as \"You've Got to Be Crazy\" (\"Dogs\") and \"Raving and Drooling\" (\"Sheep\").\nBassist Roger Waters commented, as the sessions were underway, that \"at times the group was there only physically. Our bodies were there, but our minds and feelings somewhere else.\" Eventually an idea was raised to split the epic in two, Parts I–V and Parts VI–IX. According to guitarist David Gilmour and drummer Nick Mason on the Wish You Were Here episode of In the Studio with Redbeard, Pink Floyd recorded a satisfactory take of \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\", but because of a new mixing console which was installed at Abbey Road Studios, it needed to be re-recorded because excessive 'bleed' from other instruments could be heard on the drum tracks. On part 3, a piano part seems to have been added \"live\" to the final mix, making it absent from multitrack masters. That part was re-recorded by pianist Richard Wright during the multi-channel mix used for the album Immersion Edition and the SACD release\nIn another incident, Barrett (heavyset, with a completely shaved head and eyebrows) wandered into the studio while the band was recording Wish You Were Here, although Mason has since stated that he is not entirely certain whether \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\" was the particular work being recorded when Barrett was in the studio. Because of his drastically changed appearance, the band could not recognise him for some time. When they eventually recognised Barrett, Roger Waters was so distressed he was reduced to tears. Someone asked to play the suite again and Barrett said a second playback wasn't needed when they'd just heard it. Apparently, when \"Wish You Were Here\" was played, \"He [Barrett] stood up and said, 'Right, when do I put my guitar on?'\" Wright recalled. \"And of course, he didn't have a guitar with him. And we said, 'Sorry, Syd, the guitar's all done.'\" When asked what he thought of Wish You Were Here, Barrett said it sounded a \"bit old\".

The voice predicts all of his seemingly rebellious ideas (\"You bought a guitar to punish your mom, you didn't like school, and you know you're nobody's fool\"). His illusions of personal identity are further crushed with lines such as, \"What did you dream? It's all right we told you what to dream.\"\nThe track was built upon a basic throbbing sound made by an EMS VCS 3 followed by a one-repeat echo. On the original LP, the song segued from the first 5 parts of the suite \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\" and closed the first side. On the CD pressings, especially the 1997 and 2000 remastered issues, it segues (although very faintly) to \"Have a Cigar\". This segueing is a few seconds longer on the US version than the UK version. David Gilmour admitted that he had trouble singing one line of the song; saying, \"It was a line I just couldn't reach, so we dropped the tape down half a semitone.\" He sang the part, then the pitch of the vocals were raised to meet the rest of the song.\nLike many Pink Floyd songs, \"Welcome to the Machine\" features some variations in its meter and time signatures. Each bass \"throb\" of the VCS synthesizer is notated as a quarter note in the sheet music, and each note switches from one side of the stereo spread to the next (this effect is particularly prominent when listened to on headphones). Although the introduction of the song (when the acoustic guitar enters) does not actually change time signatures, it does sustain each chord for three measures, rather than two or four, resulting in a nine-bar intro where an even number of bars might be expected. The verses and choruses are largely in 4/4, or \"common time\". However, on the line \"It's all right, we know where you've been\", a measure of 7/8 is inserted, shortening the sequence, and causing the left-right stereo panning to be reversed for quite some time. An instrumental section begins, with the acoustic guitar adding variations in its strum pattern, until it switches to 3/4 for a length of time, when a 12-string acoustic riff is introduced, ascending up the E minor scale until the chord changes to C major seventh. Finally, the instrumental section ends, and the second verse begins. With the lyric, \"It's all right, we told you what to dream\", once again a measure of 7/8 is inserted, and the stereo panning is finally returned to normal. Incidentally, these two phrases beginning with \"It's all right ...\" are the only parts to feature any chord other than some form of E minor or C major—these phrases go to an A bass in the first verse, and in the second verse, the acoustic guitar articulates the A as a major chord, with its C# in contradiction of the frequent C chords.

The radio was recorded from Gilmour's car radio. He performed the intro on a twelve-string guitar, processed to sound like it was playing through a car AM radio, and then overdubbed a fuller-sounding acoustic guitar solo. This passage was mixed to sound as though the guitarist were sitting in a car, listening to the radio; it also contains a whine that slowly changes pitch—emulating the electro-magnetic interference from the engine of a car as it accelerates and decelerates. The master tape of the original recording includes an entire performance of pedal steel guitar, played by David Gilmour, that was not used in the final mix.\nThe intro riff is repeated several times and reprised when Gilmour plays further solos with scat singing accompaniment.

It was not played live by the band for nearly ten years after this, yet became a concert staple after its reappearance in 1987, and was performed at nearly all subsequent Pink Floyd concerts. In the original 1977 concert performances, Gilmour would play his Fender Stratocaster instead of acoustic guitar, while Snowy White played a twelve-string Ovation acoustic guitar. At these shows, Nick Mason tuned an actual transistor radio on stage to a local radio station, seguing into the pre-recorded part from the album to start the song and Richard Wright would perform an extended piano coda as the wind effects played. A live version is included on Pulse. When Pink Floyd were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Gilmour and Wright (Mason was in the audience) performed the song with the assistance of their presenter Billy Corgan on rhythm guitar.", Personnel = "David Gilmour - six and twelve-string acoustic guitars, pedal steel guitar, tape effects, lead vocals, scat singing\nNick Mason - drums, tape effects\nRoger Waters - bass guitar, tape effects, backing vocals\nRichard Wright - Steinway piano, Minimoog\nStéphane Grappelli - violin", Image1 = "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/39/WishYouWereHere-300.jpg/220px-WishYouWereHere-300.jpg", AudioSrc = "https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/71957094/Pink%20Floyd/04%20Wish%20You%20Were%20Here.mp3" });

The work is a suite of nine parts, that was originally planned to take up the first side of the LP. \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\" was written at the same time as \"You've Got to Be Crazy\" (\"Dogs\") and \"Raving and Drooling\" (\"Sheep\").\nBassist Roger Waters commented, as the sessions were underway, that \"at times the group was there only physically. Our bodies were there, but our minds and feelings somewhere else.\" Eventually an idea was raised to split the epic in two, Parts I–V and Parts VI–IX. According to guitarist David Gilmour and drummer Nick Mason on the Wish You Were Here episode of In the Studio with Redbeard, Pink Floyd recorded a satisfactory take of \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\", but because of a new mixing console which was installed at Abbey Road Studios, it needed to be re-recorded because excessive 'bleed' from other instruments could be heard on the drum tracks. On part 3, a piano part seems to have been added \"live\" to the final mix, making it absent from multitrack masters. That part was re-recorded by pianist Richard Wright during the multi-channel mix used for the album Immersion Edition and the SACD release\nIn another incident, Barrett (heavyset, with a completely shaved head and eyebrows) wandered into the studio while the band was recording Wish You Were Here, although Mason has since stated that he is not entirely certain whether \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\" was the particular work being recorded when Barrett was in the studio. Because of his drastically changed appearance, the band could not recognise him for some time. When they eventually recognised Barrett, Roger Waters was so distressed he was reduced to tears. Someone asked to play the suite again and Barrett said a second playback wasn't needed when they'd just heard it. Apparently, when \"Wish You Were Here\" was played, \"He [Barrett] stood up and said, 'Right, when do I put my guitar on?'\" Wright recalled. \"And of course, he didn't have a guitar with him. And we said, 'Sorry, Syd, the guitar's all done.'\" When asked what he thought of Wish You Were Here, Barrett said it sounded a \"bit old\".

This song is significantly different from the other three songs on the album, \"Dogs\", \"Pigs\", and \"Sheep\" in that the other songs are dark, whereas this one is lighter-themed.\nThe song is divided into two parts, which are the first and last tracks of the album. Both are in stark contrast to the album's middle three misanthropic songs, and suggest that companionship can help us overcome our flaws. Roger Waters apparently refers to himself as a \"dog\" in Part 2: \"Now that I've found somewhere safe to bury my bone/And any fool knows, a dog needs a home/A shelter, from pigs on the wing.\" Another allusion is found in the line \"So I don't feel alone, or the weight of the stone\", which refers back to the dogs being \"dragged down by the stone\". Without the track on Animals, Waters thought the album \"would have just been a kind of scream of rage\".\nAccording to Nick Mason, and confirmed by Waters, it is a love song directed towards Waters' new wife at the time, Carolyne. She was really the only one of Waters' friends he had ever met who could hold her own in an argument with Waters; according to Mason you had to be very good with semantics to win an argument against Waters. Waters wrote the song because that's all he had been looking for all along: someone who could stand up to him, an equal. Carolyne, later noted by Waters, could not understand the strength, and consequently, the beauty he saw in her. The former piece of the song conveys a theme of despondency and isolation imposed upon the individual resulting from the societal pressures which work to separate the masses, a theme developed in the proceeding track, \"Dogs\". Waters conveys a hopeful theme in the latter portion of the song, illustrating the strength and emotional safety as a result of unity among individuals, a safety Waters felt quickly upon meeting Carolyne.\nOn the 8-track cartridge release, the song order was changed, and Parts 1 and 2 were played back-to-back at the beginning of the album, linked by a guitar solo. The guitar solo was performed by Snowy White. Snowy would later play the guitar solo in live performances on the 1977 In the Flesh Tour.

From the start, the song featured both Gilmour and Waters taking turns as lead vocalist. Waters modified the lyrics in some parts, transposed the key, and retitled it \"Dogs\". The version on Animals is 17 minutes long.\nThe main theme features what were, for Pink Floyd, rather unusual chords. In the final version's key of D minor, the chords are D minor ninth, E♭maj7sus2/B♭, A sus2sus4, and A♭sus2(♯11). All these chords contain the tonic of the song, D—even as a tritone, as is the case in the fourth chord.\nThe song fades in with an acoustic guitar, in D tuning, strumming the chords with a lively, syncopated rhythm, with a droning Farfisa Organ playing chord tones (A, B♭, A, and A♭, respectively). After the first sixteen-bar progression, Gilmour begins the vocal. For the third repetition, bass guitar, Hammond organ, drums and lead guitar (playing a subtle drone of D) enter. After this repetition comes the first of several guitar solos, played on a Fender Telecaster, as opposed to Gilmour's usual Stratocaster. Next is another verse of lyrics, followed by a keyboard solo. Finally, after six repetitions of the main theme, the tempo is cut in half, dramatically slower, a new chord progression is introduced, resolving gradually to the relative major, F, with two lead guitars loudly playing a slow harmonized melody, and a quieter third guitar adding decorative string bends, with heavy use of reverb and echoes.\nThe song is then stripped back down to acoustic guitar, droning on the Dm9 chord, with the bass softly striking E, the ninth of the chord, in the same range as the guitar's lowest note, D. Another slash chord movement follows, B♭ to C/B♭, followed by the key's dominant, A Major, with the minor sixth heard first at the top of the chord, in an A(add♭6), and later, as its bass note (in a progression of A, A/F, A/E, to D minor). After another guitar solo over the new progression, Gilmour sings a melismatic vocal with overdubbed harmonies, ending with the lyric \"Have a good drown/As you go down/All alone/Dragged down by the stone\", as the dissonant A/F leads back to Dm9.\nThe middle section, in a slow, metronomic 6/4 time, is built upon several layers of synthesisers, sustaining the four chords of the main theme, with the sound of dogs barking processed through a Vocoder and played as an instrument. Gilmour's last word, \"stone\", echoes slowly for many measures, gradually becoming distorted and losing its human character, before fading out completely (It reappears later on the album, in the instrumental section of \"Sheep\"). There are no guitars in this section. Gradually, a synthesiser solo emerges, and as it reaches its climax, the acoustic guitar returns, at the original tempo, once again lively and syncopated.\nThe formula of the first section is followed, but this time, with Waters singing the lead. A third guitar solo ends in three-part harmony, playing descending augmented triads, leading to Gilmour's slow, harmonized guitar melody in F Major, in a section of music indistinguishable from its first appearance in the song. This leads to the final verse, with Waters singing a new, repeating melody for the sixteen lines beginning \"Who was ...\". Originally sung over the tonic only, in the final recording the multiple harmonized guitars alternate between D minor and C Major, while the bass further extends the harmony with a descending F, E, D, and C, creating the sense of an F sixth chord followed by C/E. Originally, Waters' lyrics (\"Who was born in a house full of pain\", etc.) were echoed by Gilmour and Richard Wright in a round style, but in the final recording, only the last few are repeated, and done so by Waters himself, using tape delay. This section resolves first to B♭, then to A, before concluding with the A, F, E bass movement to a sustained Dm9, as the lyrics again end with \"dragged down by the stone\".Fitting in to the album's Orwellian concept of comparing human behavior to various animals, \"Dogs\" concentrates on the aggressive, ruthlessly competitive world of business, describing a high-powered businessman. The first two verses detail his predatory nature — outwardly charming and respectable with his \"club tie and a firm handshake, a certain look in the eye and an easy smile\", while behind this facade he lies waiting \"to pick out the easy meat...to strike when the moment is right\", and to stab those who trust him in the back. Subsequent verses portray the emptiness of his existence catching up to him as he grows older, retiring to the south rich but unloved: \"just another sad old man, all alone and dying of cancer\", and drowning under the weight of a metaphorical stone.\nThe final verse explores a number of aspects of business life and how it compares to dogs, for example taking chances and being \"trained not to spit in the fan\", losing their individuality (\"broken by trained personnel\"), obeying their superiors (\"fitted with collar and chain\"), getting treats for good behaviour (\"given a pat on the back\"), working harder than the other workers (\"breaking away from the pack\") and getting to know everyone but spending less time with family (\"only a stranger at home\"). Every line of this verse begins with the words \"Who was\", which prompted comparison to Allen Ginsberg's poem \"Howl\". However, Waters has denied the Ginsberg poem was any influence on his lyrics. Instead, these lines can be seen as subordinate clauses to the lyric line that precedes them (\"And you believe at heart everyone's a killer/Who was born in a house full of pain/Who was \").", Personnel = "Roger Waters – bass guitar, vocals, vocoder\nDavid Gilmour – vocals, acoustic and electric guitar\nRichard Wright – Fender Rhodes piano, Farfisa Organ, Hammond organ, Minimoog, ARP String Synthesizer, backing vocals\nNick Mason – drums, percussion", Image1 = "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/74/Pink_Floyd-Animals-Frontal.jpg/220px-Pink_Floyd-Animals-Frontal.jpg", AudioSrc = "https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/71957094/Pink%20Floyd/02%20Dogs.mp3" });

Those three new songs were \"You've Got to Be Crazy\" (which would later become \"Dogs\"), \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\" and \"Raving and Drooling\" (which would later become \"Sheep\").\nDuring performances of \"Raving and Drooling\", a recording of a DJ at BBC Radio called Jimmy Young was played after being cut up and reassembled randomly. This was Roger Waters' idea of a man \"raving and drooling\" (or being insane). The lyrics of the song at this point were quite different from the ones that were to become \"Sheep\".\n\"Raving and Drooling\" was originally a more jam-based song. While the basic motif was already in place -- a held note from the vocalist (Waters) being crossfaded into the same note on a synthesizer, with various inhuman effects applied -- Waters had yet to write anything for the sections repeating F♯7 and A7 (such as \"You better watch out! There may be dogs about\", and so on), and so these sections, while clearly part of the song structure, were rendered instrumentally. Ironically, while Gilmour would later state that \"Dogs\" in its earlier incarnation as \"You've Got To Be Crazy\" simply had too many words for him to sing, \"Raving and Drooling\" appeared to suffer more from a lack thereof.\nBoth \"You've Got to Be Crazy\" and \"Raving and Drooling\" were originally planned to be on the album following the tour (Wish You Were Here), but the plans were changed and they both ended up in different forms on Animals. In November 2011, versions of both tracks recorded at Wembley in 1974 were officially released as part of the Experience and Immersion versions of the Wish You Were Here album.\nIn live versions from 1977, backing guitarist Snowy White played bass guitar as Waters shared electric guitar duties with David Gilmour.

Then Roger Waters takes over the lead vocal. The piano becomes staccato, as the lyric takes on a warning tone, with Waters singing \"If you should go skating/On the thin ice of modern life....\"\nThe Wall is the story of Pink, who grows up to become an alienated and embittered rock star, with a failing marriage and feelings of megalomania. \"The Thin Ice\" can be seen as the introduction to his story, since the previous song, the album's opening track \"In The Flesh?\" is chronologically placed later in the album's narrative, and then the story is begun via flashback. \"The Thin Ice\" introduces Pink as a baby and young child, and while the lyrics assure the listener that \"Mama loves her baby, and Daddy loves you, too\", it warns that \"[T]he sea may look warm... the sky may look blue\", but \"Don't be surprised if a crack in the ice/Appears under your feet\".", Personnel = "David Gilmour — vocals (first verse), guitars, Prophet-5 synthesiser\nNick Mason — drums\nRoger Waters — vocals (second verse), bass guitar\nRichard Wright — organ, piano", Image1 = "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/13/PinkFloydWallCoverOriginalNoText.jpg/220px-PinkFloydWallCoverOriginalNoText.jpg", AudioSrc = "https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/71957094/Pink%20Floyd/02%20The%20Thin%20Ice.mp3" });

The lead instrument is the electric guitar with an added delay effect, playing roots (mostly D, G, and A over a melody in D minor). The bass and guitar figure heard during the verses, G to A, is similar to the one in \"Waiting for the Worms\", heard much later in the album. During the transition to \"Another Brick in the Wall, Part II\", the key shifts from D minor to the relative major, F major, with dramatic drum rolls and female harmony vocals.\nOn the album, \"The Happiest Days of Our Lives\" segues into \"Another Brick in the Wall, Part II\" with a loud, high-pitched scream by Roger Waters. Because of this segue, many radio stations play one right after the other, and subsequent Pink Floyd compilation albums (both Echoes and A Foot in the Door) use this song as the extended intro to Another Brick in the Wall.\nIn the film based on the album, the sound at the beginning of the song is depicted as coming from a train entering a large tunnel, rather than a helicopter heard on the album. According to Gerald Scarfe, there was supposed to be a puppet of the teacher at the end of the tunnel in the film. Alan Parker made shots of it, but it didn't work out, so they used Alex McAvoy, who played the schoolteacher, to do the scene instead.

The song has strong drums, a well-known bass line and distinctive guitar parts in the background with a smooth, yet edgy guitar solo. The song also features a choir of schoolchildren singing in the second verse: as the song ends, the sounds of a school yard are heard, along with a Scots teacher who continues to lord it over the children's lives by shouting \"Wrong! Do it again!\", and \"If you don't eat yer meat, you can't have any pudding! How can you have any pudding if you don't eat yer meat?!\", and \"You! Yes! You behind the bikesheds! Stand still, laddie!\", all of it dissolving into the dull drone of a phone ringing and ending with a deep sigh.\nAfter being insulted by the teacher, Pink dreams that the kids in his school begin to protest against their abusive teachers.

Much of the song is strikingly similar to Pigs on the Wing The majority of the song is in G Major, though the chorus is predominantly a plagal cadence in C Major. The song is notable for its varied use of time signatures, such as 5/8 and 9/8. Pink Floyd drummer Nick Mason found these time-signature changes difficult to learn, and, with the band recording on a very tight schedule, conceded the drumming duties to session drummer Jeff Porcaro.\nThe song begins quietly with solo voice and a single acoustic guitar, and gradually expands its instrumentation to include, by the song's end, reed organ, piano, drums, electric bass, and electric guitar. The song has a minimal introduction, consisting only of a sharp inhalation and rapid exhalation before the first verses are sung by Roger Waters. With exceptions (as noted above), the majority of the verses are in 4/4, or \"common time\".\nDavid Gilmour sings a chorus in 12/8 (or \"compound quadruple meter\"), in a narrative response to the first set of lyrics. Then a guitar solo follows. Waters sings another verse, which is once more followed by Gilmour's chorus (with different lyrics). Finally, the song concludes with an arrangement stripped back down to one acoustic guitar and Waters's voice, and a ritardando in which Waters sings, \"Mother did it need to be so high?\", a reference to the metaphorical wall constructed by the character Pink. The song ends on the subdominant, C Major, which may create an \"unfinished\" or \"dissatisfying\" feeling.\nFollowing 9/11, this song was one of many (including another Pink Floyd song, \"Run Like Hell\") to be included in the Clear Channel memorandum of songs with \"questionable lyrics\" which were generally not aired by Clear Channel radio stations.", Personnel = "David Gilmour — vocals (chorus), electric guitar, bass\nRoger Waters — vocals (verse), acoustic guitar\nwith:\nBob Ezrin — organ, piano\nJeff Porcaro — drums", Image1 = "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/13/PinkFloydWallCoverOriginalNoText.jpg/220px-PinkFloydWallCoverOriginalNoText.jpg", AudioSrc = "https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/71957094/Pink%20Floyd/06%20Mother.mp3" });

After the solo, Roger Waters sings the lead vocal for the rest of the song. The bridge is a chord sequence later heard on the album as \"Bring the Boys Back Home\", ending on an E minor chord, leading to a reprise of the instrumental introduction, augmented by prominent ARP Quadra riffs and a faintly audible sound of a drill. At this point, there is a piece of indecipherable whispering from the left channel. Drums and vocals then join in.

Additionally, the song contains some references to founding Pink Floyd member, Syd Barrett. The song was written after an argument between Gilmour, Waters, and co-producer Bob Ezrin during production of The Wall in which Gilmour and Ezrin challenged Waters to come up with one more song for the album. Waters then wrote \"Nobody Home\" and returned to the studio two days later to present it to the band. It was the last song written for The Wall.

It is one of only three songs on the album for which writing credits are shared between Roger Waters and David Gilmour. The chorus melody was written by Gilmour while Waters contributed the lyrics and the music for the verses. The song had the working title of \"The Doctor\". An early version of the song was included under this title on the \"Immersion Box Set\" of The Wall, released in 2012.\nWhile most songs on The Wall were written by Waters alone, most of the music for \"Comfortably Numb\" was written by David Gilmour, who originally recorded the instrumental demo during the latter stages of recording his first solo album, hoping to find some later use for it. Gilmour later brought his demo of it to The Wall sessions. In Gilmour's original demo, though there were no lyrics, he sang a melody not unlike the final version of the chorus. The verses, however, were in the key of E minor (a progression of E minor, D major, C major, A minor, and back to E minor again), rather than B minor, as in the final version. Also, the chord sequence for the final chorus line \"I have become comfortably numb\" did not exist in Gilmour's demo. So, while the music is widely considered to be Gilmour's work, it is likely that Waters composed the chords for that line, as well as making the decision to change the verses from E minor to B minor.\nThis song features two guitar solos by David Gilmour. The first solo is played over a shortened version of the chorus music, and the longer outro solo is played over the verse structure. In 1989, the readers of the Pink Floyd fanzine, The Amazing Pudding, voted this song the best Floyd song of all time. David Gilmour's solo was rated the 2nd best guitar solo of all-time by Guitar World magazine, in a reader poll. Also in Guitar World, there were details on David Gilmour's \"Comfortably Numb\" solo, stating that the solo (most likely the outro solo) was pieced together from several other solos that he had been experimenting with at the time; this was accomplished by recording several solos and marking his preferred segments for the perfect final take.

The lyrics are explicitly threatening, directed at the listener, one with an \"empty smile\" and \"hungry heart\", \"dirty feelings\" and a \"guilty past\", \"nerves in tatters\" as \"hammers batter down your door.\" Even the act of lovemaking is doomed, for \"if they catch you in the back seat trying to pick her locks\", the results will be fatal. Although the lyric \"You better run like hell\" appears twice in the liner notes, the title is never actually sung; each verse simply concludes with \"You better run\".\nIn the film adaptation, Pink directs his jackbooted thugs to attack the \"riff-raff\" mentioned in the previous song, in which he ordered them to raid and destroy the homes of queers, Jews, and black people, among others. One scene depicts an interracial couple cuddling in the back seat of a car when a group of neo-Nazis accost them, beating the boy and raping the girl.\nThe guitar intro begins with the scratching of strings dampened with left-hand muting, before settling on an open D string dampened by palm muting. As heard earlier on the album, on \"Another Brick in the Wall (Part 1)\", the muted D is treated with a specific delay setting, providing three to four loud but gradually decaying repeats, one dotted-eighth note apart, with the result that simply playing quarter notes (at 116 beats per minute) will produce a strict rhythm of one eighth note followed by two sixteenth notes, with rhythmic echoes overlapping. Over this pedal tone of D, Gilmour plays descending triads in D major (mostly D, A, and G), down to the open chord position (a quieter, second overdubbed guitar plays open chords only).

The count-in is Eins, zwei, drei, Alle — German for \"one, two, three, everybody\".

This means that Pink has committed a crime against himself by actually attempting to interact with his fellow human beings.
